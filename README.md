# Hey, I’m Chris 👋  

Cloud & DevOps Engineer | Systems Administrator | Automation Enthusiast  

I build and maintain reliable, scalable infrastructure. My focus is on cloud platforms, containerization, automation, and monitoring — making systems resilient, observable, and easy to deploy.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Design and manage cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS)
- Containerize applications with Docker
- Orchestrate workloads with Kubernetes
- Build CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, YAML workflows)
- Implement monitoring & logging (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- Automate infrastructure and operational tasks
- Strengthen security posture and system hardening

I enjoy turning manual processes into automated systems and transforming “it works on my machine” into repeatable, production-ready deployments.
